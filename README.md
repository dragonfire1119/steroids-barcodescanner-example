Example of using the built-in barcode scanner plugin with Appgyver Steroids. This example was built from the default application template after running ```steroids create DIR```.

Note that the ```<plugin>``` line in config.ios.xml is different than what is provided by default.

If trying to load a modal after scanning something, see the note and example in www/javascripts/application.js.
